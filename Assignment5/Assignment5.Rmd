## Assignment – Tidying and Transforming Data


The chart above describes arrival delays for two airlines across five destinations. Your task is to:
(1) Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information above.
You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the information appears above, so
that you can practice tidying and transformations as described below.
(2) Read the information from your .CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy
and transform your data.
(3) Perform analysis to compare the arrival delays for the two airlines.
(4) Your code should be in an R Markdown file, posted to rpubs.com, and should include narrative
descriptions of your data cleanup work, analysis, and conclusions. Please include in your
homework submission:

 The URL to the .Rmd file in your GitHub repository. and

 The URL for your rpubs.com web page.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("readxl")
library("tidyr")
library("dplyr")
library("Hmisc")
library("ggplot2")

#Read from csv file
airlinesData_csv <- read.csv("TwoAirlines.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
#airlinesData_csv

#Find the datatype of AirlinesData_df first
typeof(airlinesData_csv)

# then Convert to data frame
AirlinesData_df <- data.frame(airlinesData_csv)

```

### let's go to work

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Let's look at our data and start cleaning up from here
AirlinesData_df

#Rename the weired column to something meaningful
AirlinesData_df <- AirlinesData_df %>%
  rename(airline = X, status = X.1, los_angeles = Los.Angeles, phoenix = Phoenix, san_diego = San.Diego, san_franciso = San.Franciso, seattle = Seattle)
AirlinesData_df

#Remove NA rows
AirlinesData_df <- AirlinesData_df[-c(3),] 
AirlinesData_df

#Add missing values
AirlinesData_df[2, "airline"] <- "ALASKA"
AirlinesData_df[4, "airline"] <- "AM WEST"

#now we can reset our index
rownames(AirlinesData_df) <- NULL

#Adding factor
AirlinesData_df$airline <- factor(AirlinesData_df$airline)

AirlinesData_df

#What are the column names now
names(AirlinesData_df)

#what datatypes do we have now
sapply(AirlinesData_df, typeof)

#structure of our data
describe(AirlinesData_df)

```

**Store our cleaned data into a csv file**

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
write.csv(AirlinesData_df, "./cleanAirlines.csv", row.names=FALSE)

#store our data into a temp dataframe
tempAirlines <- AirlinesData_df
tempAirlines
```


**Analyze this!!**

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#gathering these columns
names(tempAirlines)[3:7]

#Apply and view output
airLines_analysis1 <- gather(tempAirlines, "city", "num", names(tempAirlines)[3:7], factor_key=TRUE)
airLines_analysis1

airLines_analysis1 <-  airLines_analysis1 %>%
                 spread(status, `num`)
airLines_analysis1

airLines_analysis1 <- airLines_analysis1 %>% 
  mutate(total = delayed + `on time`, percent_delayed = delayed/ total, percent_ontime = `on time`/ total) 
airLines_analysis1

ggplot(data=airLines_analysis1, aes(x=airline, y=percent_ontime)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=0.5, fill="#52823f") +
  xlab("Airlines") + ylab("On Time") +
  ggtitle("On Time")

ggplot(data=airLines_analysis1, aes(x=airline, y=percent_delayed)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=0.5, fill="#82423f") +
  xlab("Airlines") + ylab("Delays") +
  ggtitle("Delays")
```
**we observe that AM West has more delays and less on time flights than ALASKA.**



```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data=airLines_analysis1, aes(x = airline, y=percent_ontime, fill = city)) +  
          geom_bar(stat="identity",position="dodge") + 
          xlab("Airlines") + ylab("On Time") + ggtitle("On Time per Airport")


ggplot(data=airLines_analysis1, aes(x = airline, y=percent_delayed, fill = city)) +  
          geom_bar(stat="identity",position="dodge") + 
          xlab("Airlines") + ylab("Delays") + ggtitle("On Time per Airport")

```
**When it comes to major airports, there are more delays there. Might be in these major airports, AM WEST conducts more flights than in ALASKA.let's check our assumption graphically, shall we?**


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Apply and view output
airLines_analysis2 <- gather(tempAirlines, "city", "num", names(tempAirlines)[3:7], factor_key=TRUE)
airLines_analysis2

ggplot(data=airLines_analysis2, aes(x = airline, y=num, fill = city)) +  
          geom_bar(stat="identity",position="dodge") + 
          xlab("Airlines") + ylab("Number of Flights") + ggtitle("Number of Flights per Airport")


```
**We can see clearly that AM West is running few flights in the major airport, but has more delays than ALASKA. So our previous assumption was totally wrong.**


### Finally, I think ALASKA has a better flight records than AM WEST because of other reasons. Perhaps, ALASKA has a better reservation system, a better flight maintenance, or a better operating hub. We cannot tell from the small dataset we have. We need a big dataset with lot of of observations and lot of columns. For now, our small dataset is not enough to conclude anything, and or derive any interesting insights.
